			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p class="par">
				This website is operated by Flight Network UK Ltd, which is part of
				the Etraveli Group. The companies within the Etraveli Group handle a
				variety of personal data, such as names, e-mail addresses and other
				travel related information in their daily businesses. Therefore, we
				take data security and adherence to data protection legislation very
				seriously. This privacy policy explains how we collect, store, use
				and disclose any personal data we collect about you when you use
				this website, as well as how we protect the privacy and
				confidentiality of your personal information. Your privacy matters
				to us so whether you are new to our service or a long-time user;
				please take the time to become familiar with practices and routines
				– and contact us if you have any questions.<br> <br>
				Etraveli Group AB, reg. no. 556584-4684 (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is
				the “data controller” of your personal data and is therefore
				responsible for the lawfulness of what we do with your personal
				data.
			</p>
			<h2>The personal data we collect</h2>
			<p class="par">
				Generally, the type of personal data we collect is the information
				that we need to enable you to make your travel arrangements and
				reservations. This includes information such as your first and last
				name, date of birth, gender, telephone number, passport information,
				e-mail address, and payment data. The personal data we must receive
				to provide you with the travel arrangement you have
				reserved/purchased via our website is the only data that is
				mandatory to provide. Depending on the kind of travel services you
				use, we may also collect your frequent flyer number, information
				about your dietary requirements and health issues (if any), and
				other details which are relevant to your travel arrangements, or
				which are required by another travel service provider (such as
				airlines, insurance providers or otherwise). This is not an
				exhaustive list. Should you call our customer support, we will
				collect the data you provide during the phone call. As you can see
				below and in our Cookie Policy, our cookies on our website also
				collect some information.<br> <br> We may lawfully obtain
				data about you from business partners and other independent
				third-party sources. For example, personal data, such as purchases
				or demographic data, may be provided by our fraud detection
				providers.<br> <br> If you make a reservation for someone
				else via our website, we will request personal data about that
				individual. In those circumstances, we rely on you to advise those
				individuals about this Privacy Policy and to obtain their consent.
				Access to view or change their data will only be available by using
				your e-mail address.
			</p>
			<h2>The sensitive personal data we collect</h2>
			<p class="par">
				In some cases, we may collect and process “special categories of
				personal data” about you, which is considered sensitive. This would
				be the case, for example, if you (i) have submitted a medical
				certificate for use of a cancellation protection or a refund from an
				airline, (ii) have a medical or health condition affecting your trip
				and for which you request assistance or where certain clearance is
				needed, or (iii) have made a request revealing some other sensitive
				personal data about you<br> <br> Before we handle
				sensitive personal data about you, we require your consent to do so.
				We therefore ask you to use the dedicated contact forms on our
				website for submitting any sensitive data. The contact forms enable
				you to give us the consent required under applicable data protection
				legislation. Such consent may of course be withdrawn at any time by
				contacting us (please refer to the section on “How to contact us” in
				this policy). We will not handle any sensitive personal data that we
				are not permitted by you to handle, or that you have not provided us
				with. A limited number of our personnel will have access to your
				personal data which is considered sensitive, and after processing
				your sensitive data in accordance with your request, we will delete
				the data as soon as possible unless otherwise required by law.
			</p>
			<h2>Sharing your personal data</h2>
			<p class="par">
				We will only share your personal data where necessary for the
				purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. This may be to other
				companies within the Etraveli Group, to governmental authorities for
				compliance with law and to our trusted business partners. We may
				share your personal data (including sensitive personal data when
				applicable) with travel service providers you have made
				reservations/purchased tickets with (such as airlines), with other
				service providers for services you have purchased (such as insurance
				companies) and with global distribution systems (referred to as
				GDSs) that make it technically possible to enable your travel
				arrangements and make reservations/purchase tickets.<br>
				<br> Each partner is responsible for its own handling of your
				personal data after it has received it from us, meaning that you
				must contact the partner in question for any requests related to
				your rights under applicable data protection legislation. The
				partners may be located worldwide, and we recommend that you read
				the partners’ respective privacy policies for information on their
				handling of your personal data. <br>
				<br>We will also share your personal data with other companies
				(“data processors”) needed to deliver the services you requested,
				such as service providers running our call centers and our other
				suppliers and vendors that will handle your personal data when
				providing their services to us (for example external storage). It
				also includes payment- and fraud service providers, IT
				infrastructure providers, software solution and software engineers,
				and finance-, administrative- and legal services and tools. When a
				data processor handles your personal data, they only do so with
				sufficient security measures in place and only in accordance with
				instructions provided by us. This Privacy Policy applies to the data
				processors’ handling of your personal data.
			</p>
			<h2>Data security</h2>
			<p class="par">In order to keep your personal data secure, we
				have implemented a number of technical and organizational security
				measures and we maintain a high level of security in all systems.
				Such security measures include, but are not limited to:<br><br>

				<h5># traceability, disaster recovery, access limitations, etc.;</h5>
				<h5># pseudonymization and encryption when appropriate; </h5><h5># handling payment
				data in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security
				Standards (PCI DSS); and</h5><h5># using secure connections that encrypt your
				data through the Internet, avoiding anyone to steal your information
				in transit. </h5><br><br>In addition, we have adopted policies to ensure that our
				employees (who are subject to confidentiality obligations) do not
				use personal data when it is not necessary. Such policies also set
				out our standards for when we contract suppliers or introduce new IT
				systems within our operations.</p>
